This repository contains a Clarity smart contract designed to serve as a secure, audit-friendly escrow mechanism for Web3 agreements. Built to run seamlessly on the Stacks blockchain, this escrow contract integrates with any SIP-010 compliant token (such as stablecoins or wrapped assets) and can be monitored in analytics tools like Google Clarity for transaction insights.

üöÄ Key Features

Universal Token Support
Works with any SIP-010 fungible token (STX-wrapped assets, USDT, USDC, etc.).

Safe Escrow Lifecycle

create ‚Üí Define payer, payee, token, and deadline.

lock ‚Üí Ensure contract balance is funded before escrow becomes valid.

release ‚Üí Payer sends funds securely to payee.

refund ‚Üí Payer reclaims funds if deadline passes and payment not released.

Clear On-Chain Events
Every major action (escrow_created, escrow_locked, escrow_released, escrow_refunded) emits a structured print event for easy off-chain tracking in analytics dashboards (Google Clarity, Microsoft Clarity, or custom Web3 monitors).

Time-Lock Safety
Prevents funds from being locked indefinitely. If not released by the deadline, payer can always reclaim tokens.

Minimal Attack Surface

Uses as-contract execution to ensure only the contract itself performs token transfers.

Strong error handling (ERR-ALREADY-LOCKED, ERR-NOT-PAYER, etc.) for predictable execution.
